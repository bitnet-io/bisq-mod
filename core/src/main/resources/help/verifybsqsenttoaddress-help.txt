NAME
----
verifybsqsenttoaddress - verify BSQ sent to wallet address

SYNOPSIS
--------
verifybsqsenttoaddress
		--address=<bsq-address>
		--amount=<bsq-amount>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Verify an exact amount of BSQ was sent to a specific Bisq wallet's BSQ address.
Receipt of BSQ to a BSQ (altcoin) payment account address should always be verified
before a BSQ seller sends a confirmpaymentreceived message for a BSQ/BTC trade.

Warning:  The verification result should be considered a false positive if a BSQ wallet
address has received the same amount of BSQ in more than one transaction.  A way to
avoid this problem is to use different BSQ payment accounts for different trades, so
the payment account receiving address will vary from trade to trade.  Another way is to
slightly vary your offer amounts and BSQ prices (if you are the maker), to make sure the
received BSQ amounts vary from trade to trade.  Doing all of the above further reduces
the chance of a false positive.  Another step is to check your BSQ wallet balance when
you verify BSQ has been received to an address.
